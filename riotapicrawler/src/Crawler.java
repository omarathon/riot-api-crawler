/*
    A League of Legends match crawler, utilising taycaldwell's Riot Games API Java Library.
    (Ref: https://github.com/taycaldwell/riot-api-java)

    Functionality:
    Provide your Riot API key, as well as an OutputHandler, CrawlerConfig and Path where the logs shall be generated.
    - Note: one may use preset OutputHandlers and CrawlerConfigs provided.

    After constructing a Crawler object, one calls run with an input summoner, which shall crawl on a separate Thread indefinitely from the input summoner
    until either a dead end or stop() was called asynchronously.
    Logs detailing the operation shall be generated at the input log directory, in a file at path: directory/riotapicrawler-log.log

    Crawling a player:
    - fetch their match history from the Riot API, with the number of recent games specified in the crawler config.
    - pass each match in their recent match history to the output handler which shall process each Match object.
    - iterate over each Match, determining which Matches are crawlable by the crawler config's match filter.
    - On the crawlable Matches, fetch the players in that game from the Riot API.
    - Repeatedly pick a random player from the Match until the player is crawlable, as specified in the crawler config's summoner filter,
      and if the player has not already been crawled.
    - if found, go to step 1 with this new player.
    - otherwise, we have iterates over all matches and found no crawlable players in each, therefore we have reached a dead end, STOP CRAWLING.
